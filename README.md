# Operating-Systems

This repository contains code written for my operating systems course for the DLXOS simulated UNIX like operating system. It contains a 
lottery schedular I designed for the system that contains a program to generate test processes with various priority levels. This 
repository also has a program to demonstrate mutual exclusion and a kernal level trap for DLXOS.
